### 🌎 **From Dolphin Drama & Chimp Gossip to Data Insights**  
Before diving into data science, I spent years studying **animal social relationships** in the wild.  
🐬 **In Shark Bay, Australia**, I analysed **bottlenose dolphin social association patterns**, using **playback experiments** and **drone technology**.  
🐵 **In the Budongo forest, Uganda**, I studied **friendships between male chimpanzees**, focusing on how they use **vocal communication** to maintain **group cohesion**. 

Now, I apply the same **curiosity, analytical mindset, and storytelling approach** to uncover insights in **data-driven decision-making**. 🚀
